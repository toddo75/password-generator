#Password-Generator

# Description

Given starter code from class, I finished the code and made certain it has the proper acceptance criteria 
attributes. 

## User Story

```
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security

```


## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page

```

## Credits

Original coding was given to me by the bootcamp teacher.  My tutor Katherine Redford assisted me with the coding in 
Javascript, pointing me in the right direction.  I also used code throughout the file that I learned on my own
with sources such as StackOverflow.
